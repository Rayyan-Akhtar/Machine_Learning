In this program only one image is used to calculate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

This program consists of main script file and functions file. 
Main script file is named as myCameraCalibration. 
This is also included with an image of checkerboard taken by webcam of my laptop at 640x480 resolution. 
This program will calculate the points in terms of pixels on the checkerboard image 
i.e. image coordinated and their corresponding world coordinates are used to calculate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using linear approach. 
Vector decomposition approach is used in this algorithm.
